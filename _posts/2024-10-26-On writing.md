## My Journey So Far
Back in college, I used to travel home by train—a journey that took more than a day. To pass the time, I’d often download movies, sometimes watching up to three in one go. But after binge-watching like that, my mind felt completely burnt out. So, I started paying more attention to the people around me. When that got old, I turned my focus inward.
<br><br>
I began to wonder about ways to improve my life—new routines to try, strategies for getting through my syllabus just in time for exams, whether to let my hair grow out, or how to run faster and longer. I even pondered why I always ended up next to older passengers or thought about where to stash my luggage safely. Among these thoughts, the idea of journaling struck me. That day, I had watched the movie *The Pursuit of Happyness* and was feeling especially grateful for my family. I opened a diary app and poured out my thoughts. And that’s how my journey with journaling began.

## Writing to Connect and Inspire
Once a month, while scrolling through the internet, I find an article that really pushes the boundaries of my thinking. That’s the kind of person I want to become—a writer who gets people to think differently. I want to blog; some posts might be good, some might not be so great. But if sharing my journey can inspire even one person, then putting my thoughts out there will be totally worth it.

All the inspiration aside, my articles are probably going to be shitty and pretty random for at least a couple of years—so read at your own risk.
