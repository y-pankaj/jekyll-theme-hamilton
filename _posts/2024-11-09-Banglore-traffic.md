Geetings, brave souls of Banglore.

Lets face the truth, Banglore traffic is not a part of our life; its our life. A 5 km commute in Bangalore would make teerth yatris feel like they're on a luxury tour. The solution to the problem actually requires a mentality shift, on how Banglore actually forces to be your most productive self. So pack you pollution masks, charge you phones and lets being the survival guide. ðŸ’ª

## Wake up early, I mean really really early!
Did you know the New York Times bestseller The 4AM Club was actually written to inspire Bangaloreans to wake up earlyâ€”just so they could beat the traffic? Bet you didnâ€™t see that one coming! 
<br><br>
Anytime between 8:30 to 11:30 in the morning are considered the peak hours, peak hours of frustation. So you are better off waking up early soaking in that Vitamin D while you travel ;)

## Carpooling and networking
If youâ€™re tired of traveling in sweat-soaked, smelly, slow-as-a-tortoise public transport with stops that seem strategically inconvenient, then carpooling is the way to go! If you own a car please do open up to carpooling, it build your network. One of my carpooling buddy that I gave referral to actually ended up in my company. And if you don't have a car go network so that you can find your carpooling buddy.
<br><br>
Only Bangalore traffic has the power to turn introverts into networking prosâ€”whether we like it or not!
<br><br>
Pro tip: Use apps like Quick Ride to find your carpool buddy.

## The journey
Ok, I see you woke up early. Found your not so comfortable seat in a bus, or a car. Now you must optimize your time during the journey. <br><br>
If its a short 20 min ride - take a power nap, cath up on the news.<br><br>
If your ride takes 40 min to an hour - attend your scrum :) , reply to your emails so people feel like you are already in the office and have started working. <br><br>
If your ride takes 1-2 hrs - surrender to the podcast hosts. Andrew Huberman bhaiya will help you regulate your emotions by recommending various supplementsâ€”I bet he has one specifically for Bengaluru traffic. Sir Lex Fridman may come across as saintly, but I'm sure Bengaluru traffic would drive him mad. And finally, listen to Joe Rogan dada explain why Bengaluru will never be attacked by aliensâ€”because even they wouldn't be able to navigate through it. <br><br>
If your ride takes more than hour -  you are better off sleeping in your office. Why even consider going home?
<br><br>
I used to listen to Joe Rogan 5 days a week while commuting (read as crawling through traffic), and now Iâ€™m an alien species expert, just waiting for the day I can ditch the corporate grind and start signing peace treaties with extraterrestrials instead.

## You can always blame google maps
Imagine opening Google Maps to check how long it'll take you to get somewhere. It says 20 minutes, so you head out on time. But halfway through, this dumbass app decides to add an extra 30 minutes without warning ðŸ˜­. If you rely on Google Maps, you're never going to be on timeâ€”-youâ€™ll either be way too early or far too late. Iâ€™ve developed serious trust issues with this app.
<br><br>
But hereâ€™s the silver liningâ€”itâ€™s a blessing in disguise. Late to the office? Blame Google Maps. Late to a date? Google Maps again. Late to a football game? Yep, you guessed it, blame Google Maps. I never have to come up with any other excuse.

## Conclusion
Enough said, go out and figure out your life--while stuck in the traffic, you will never get this time back--after the metro starts functioning. Enjoy the chaos while you can, because soon enough you daily existential crisis will be replaced with the smooth ride.
